README - run_analysis.R
=======================

The process in which the run_analysis code works will be described in a series of steps that are shown inside the file.

1. DOWNLOAD AND UNZIP THE UCI HAR DATASET

2. CONVERT .TXT FILES IN THE UCI HAR DATASET INTO DATA FRAMES

3. MERGE SUBJECT, Y & X DATA FRAMES CREATING A NEW DATA FRAME

4. CHANGE HEADERS OF FIRST 2 COLUMNS: "Subject" AND "Activity"

5. REPLACE NUMBERS IN "Activity" COLUMN WITH THE TEXT VALUES THAT APPEAR IN THE activity_labels DATASET

6. REPLACE REMAINING HEADERS WITH THE TEXT VALUES THAT APPEAR IN THE features DATASET

7. EXTRACT ONLY COLUMNS IN THE DATA FRAME WHERE MEAN OR STANDARD DEVIATION ARE FOUND

8. FIND OUT MEAN FOR EACH COLUMN DEPENDING ON "Subject" AND "Activity"

9. CREATE INDEPENDENT DATA SET (final_results.txt) IN THE SELECTED REPO
